<p>For this particular project, we were mostly interested in the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Did the number of pitchers used in a game increase over time (both between seasons and within seasons)?</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="/dashboard/q1_flexdashboard.html"><em>Dashboard</em></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Do different umpires, ballparks, or teams have more runs, home runs, strike-outs, or walks than others in the 21st century?</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="/tables/umpire_tables/"><em>Tables for Umpires</em></a></li>
<li><a href="/map/ballpark-map/"><em>Ballpark Map</em></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>What day of the week is there the highest batting average? Is this different between weekdays and weekends? What about across months?</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="/tables/wday_month_stats/"><em>Tables</em></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>How has the game evolved between regular season play and the postseason? These questions will consist of time of game, home and away team game statistics, and home-field advantage or win probability, based on whether the games are regular season or postseason.</strong>
