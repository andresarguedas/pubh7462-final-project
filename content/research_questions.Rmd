For this particular project, we were mostly interested in the following questions:

1. **Did the number of pitchers used in a game increase over time (both between seasons and within seasons)?**

2. **Do different umpires, ballparks, or teams have more runs, home runs, strike-outs, or walks than others in the 21st century?**
    - [*Tables for Umpires*](/tables/umpire_tables/) 
    - [*Ballpark Map*](/map/ballpark-map/)
3. **What day of the week is there the highest batting average? Is this different between weekdays and weekends? What about across months?**
    - [*Tables*](/tables/wday_month_stats/)
4. **How has the game evolved between regular season play and the postseason? These questions will consist of time of game, home and away team game statistics, and home-field advantage or win probability, based on whether the games are regular season or postseason.**
